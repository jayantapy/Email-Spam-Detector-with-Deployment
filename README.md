<h4> Email Spam Detection has been a very common and popular subject of interest in Classification problems. Basically we need to predict whether or not a certain email is Spam or Not Spam(or Ham) based on the textual data that is contained in the mail.</h4>


<h4> In this project, I used MultiNomial Naive Bayes algorithm for this particular classification task. One of the reason for me to use this algorithm was that I got an accuracy of about 98% which is quite nice. </h4>

<h4> AFter building the model, I used Heroku environment to deploy my model and built a GUI. This would enable the user to directly enter the message and know whether the message is spam or not. </h4>

<h4> I used HTML and CSS, and well as Flask API to build the web page. The screenshots of the webpage is attached as below. </h4>
